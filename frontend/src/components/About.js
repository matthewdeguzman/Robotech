        have decided to come together and collaborate to make their biggest project yet, "Schedule Recommender (Name TBA)"
        for the Robotech hackathon hosted by Georgia Tech IEEE. They seek to improve the mental health of students worldwide
        by devising a website that recommends users a priority-based schedule that tells them what events to complete
        based on factors such as their due date and duration. Together, they are a force to reckon with and many are exhilerated
        and filled with excitement to see the end result.</div> );
