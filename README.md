## Dependencies

We use the node.js and react.js frameworks to build and run the application. A mock database is used to model a backend server.

To download the dependencies, run the following commands in the root directory using the terminal to download the dependencies form the package.json file.

`cd frontend`

`npm install`

Then, you can run `npm start` to start the app and a new tab will open in your default browser at `localhost:3000`.
